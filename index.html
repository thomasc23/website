  <h1>Thomas Chamberlain</h1>
  <p>I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Rochester, where I use quantitative methods and causal inference to study American politics. Substantively, my research falls into the subfields of American Political Behavior and American Political Development. I am interested in improving empirical measurements of political preferences, quantifying the effect of media and political communications on voter preferences, and understanding how parties and voters interact across issue domains over time. Previously, I studied political philosophy at Stanford University and worked in NYC politics.</p>
