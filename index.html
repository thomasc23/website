            <h1>Thomas Chamberlain</h1>
            <p>I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Rochester, where I use quantitative methods and causal inference to study American politics. Substantively, my research primarily falls into the subfields of American political development and historical political economy, with a focus on how historical policies and institutions shape subsequent political divisions. A second strand of my work involves estimating formal models of multidimensional electoral competition to understand how parties and voters interact across issue domains over time. Previously, I studied political philosophy at Stanford University and worked in NYC politics.</p>
