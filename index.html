            <h1>Thomas Chamberlain</h1>
            <p>I am currently a PhD student in Political Science at the University of Rochester, where I use quantitative methods and causal inference to study American political development and historical political economy. I'm interested in the ways that historical policies and institutions shape current politics and electoral conflict. Previously, I studied political philosophy at Stanford University and worked in NYC politics.</p>
